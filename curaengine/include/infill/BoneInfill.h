/*!
 * Infill that mimics the structure of spongy (trabecular) bone.
 *
 * Trabecular bone is a connected network of thin plates and rods that lines up with the main load direction and gets
 * denser towards the hard outer shell. This is imitated with a smooth random 3D field, a sum of many cosine waves
 * ("spinodoid" structure): the infill follows the surface where the field crosses a fixed level, which gives a
 * bicontinuous, organic network of plates. The directions of the waves decide how the structure is oriented: waves
 * mostly perpendicular to the main direction give struts running along it. Because the field is continuous, the
 * pattern changes smoothly from layer to layer, so each layer is supported by the one below it.
